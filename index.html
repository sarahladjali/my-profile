	<h2> Boxing 🥊</h2>
		<p> I have been doing Thai boxing for almost 6 years. It is the activity that takes me most of my time during the week, after school. It's a very rich fighting sport both in terms of techniques and culture. I have been competing for 4 years and I am at a national level. If you are curious, check at <a href = "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay-tha%C3%AF/" target="_blank"> this link </a> to discover this discipline. </p>
